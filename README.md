# Port Scanner and SSH Brute Force Script

This Python script performs basic port scanning on a target host and optionally attempts an SSH brute-force attack if port 22 is open.

## ⚠ Legal Warning

**This script is for educational purposes and authorized penetration testing only.**  
Do not use it against systems you do not have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Scan a range of TCP ports on a target host.
- Identify open ports.
- Attempt SSH brute-force login if port 22 is open, using a supplied username and password list.

##  Sample Usage

```bash
python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.10 --ports 20-25,80,443 --username admin --passwords PasswordList.txt
```
