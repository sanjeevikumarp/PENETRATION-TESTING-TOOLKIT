# Port Scanner and SSH Brute Force Script

This Python script performs basic port scanning on a target host and optionally attempts an SSH brute-force attack if port 22 is open.

## âš  Legal Warning

**This script is for educational purposes and authorized penetration testing only.**  
Do not use it against systems you do not have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Scan a range of TCP ports on a target host.
- Identify open ports.
- Attempt SSH brute-force login if port 22 is open, using a supplied username and password list.
